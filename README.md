# Brief summary of me

If I have to defined myself, I would like to borrow Frankl's idea:

1. I would like to live a simple life, creating new representations and seeing the world through these new representations
2. I would like to experience the worlds and model or represent it using many representations
3. I would like to fight nihilisim, whether in me or another person
