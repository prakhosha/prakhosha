# Brief summary of me

A generalist who is interested in complex system science. What is complex system science? In my words, systems in which their behaviors cannot be modeled using reductionism. Hence forces us to see them holistically.

If I have to explain what drives me, let me borrow Frankl's idea of meaning:

1. I would like to live a simple life, creating new representations and seeing the world through these new representations
2. I would like to experience the worlds and model or represent it using many representations
3. I would like to fight nihilisim, whether in me or another person

Also love to: reads, writes, musics both listening and playing it through a guitar, I also like to play videgames... so just hit me up when you want to play some videogames with me :D.
